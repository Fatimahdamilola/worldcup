        The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. The 22nd FIFA World Cuo is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022; it is the frst World Cup to be held in the Arab World and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournamner in South Korea and Japan. France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held, this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion, and other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup">See more</a>
